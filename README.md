# Face-based-attendance-system
In this project we create a web application that can take video from web cam and recognize the face of student and if the student photo stores in dataset. it can mark the student name ,time and date in the attendance file called attendance_list . After the attendance is taken from web cam it closed by clicking Q in video section .If the teachers want to send attendance in there email the teacher have to click on send attendance to Gmail. After class is over teacher have to clear the attendance list by clicking on clear attendance. So this process is repeated in every class to take attendance based on face recognition and detection.
